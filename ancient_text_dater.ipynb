SVD is more flexible in handling non-linear relationships and can be used as a general-purpose dimensionality reduction technique. We were able to determine our data was non-linear by comparing the results of models based on linear and nonlinear approaches. Our nonlinear models outperformed our linear models by far. SVD is also useful when dealing with sparse data, which is the case for our data. SVD seemed like a better option due to the size of our dataset as well. PCA involves calculating a covariance matrix which would take longer than SVD to process."

    "A random forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision tress to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. The algorithm does something called bootstrap sampling, which randomly selects samples with replacement from the training data to create several datasets for training the individual trees we specified in the parameter. For each decision tree, the algorithm selects a random subset of features at each split. Each tree in the forest predicts a value and the final prediction is the average of all tree predictions in the forest. Random Forest is effective at solving tasks because it uses many tress instead of a single deicision tree to make an accurate prediction. This ensemble reduces variance in the predictions. It also handles complex, nonlinear relationships in the data which seems to be the case in our dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that combines weak learners (like shallow decision trees) sequentially to form a strong learner. Each new tree is trained to correct errors made by the previous shallow trees. Gradient boosting minimizes the update function by computing gradients of the loss with respect to the model's predictions. The XGBoost frameowkr in particular has regularization to prevent overfitting, is optimized for speed and low memory usage, and supports sparse data.\n",
